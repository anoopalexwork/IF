And no longer certain if I want to be.<br> I had first seen a bard, at age 6, after Lord Whitwere celebrated the birth of his first child in our village of Mayflower. At the feast, he had brought his bard, Adam Cutter, from the castle. A man of who was graciously allowed to talk freely of all, including the lord and his lady.<br>. Adam was dressed in clothes much finer than anyone at our village ever wore. His words were simple but everyone smiled at them. Our village mother, he called 'a sweet face among other sweet faces'. Indeed, a fair face leading the sweet puddin\' race'. He sang songs, beautiful ones, both traditional and unknown.<br>");
